    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>Overal, in this project we implemented a simple cloth simulation. We started by defining all of our masses, and connecting them through springs with three different types of constraints; shearing, bending, and structural. From here, we are ready to begin the actual simulation portion. For this homework we used Verlet integration, where we compute all of the forces acting on each of our point masses, and then use those forces and the last position to find the next position. We also constrain our next position to be at most 10% greater than the previous position, to that none of the springs become unreasonably deformed. The next two stages dealth with collisions, first with a sphere and plane so that the cloth could rest on other objects, and then afterwards self-collisions which we implemented by hashing a point mass's position and using that hash-map to find any potential candidates for collision. Finally, we ended the project with shaders. We started with diffuse shading, then modified it to support specular reflections in what is known as Blinn-Phong shading. We also made use of textures with texture mapping, displacement mapping, and bump mapping. The latter of the two are both methods to project some texture onto our meshes to make them seem more 3D; with the major difference between them being that displacement mapping actually changes the positions of the vertices while bump mapping can only affect the normals in lighting calculations. Finally, we added environment mapped reflections by sampling a texture using the reflected outgoing camera ray.</p>

  </a>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      We see that with a low spring constant, it becomes much less firm and sags more in the middle with more creases. As we increase the spring constant, the cloth rests in a form that is closer to the square that it starts in. We can also observe this if we have a high spring constant, then lower it without restarting the simulation; this results in the cloth becoming visibly less tense and sagging more. 
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Similar to (but inverse) the behavior of changing the spring constant, we see that with a very low density the cloth will rest in a state that is very close to the original square shape. As we increase the density the increased weight causes additional force on the springs, and we will see additional folds as the center unpinned portion of the cloth sags more.
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The damping constant affects how much the cloth moves for each simulation step. This makes sense because we take (1-damping) and multiply that by the new position. So the more we damp, we are getting a smaller fraction of the change in position that is contributed from the difference of the current position and last position. So with maximum damping, all of the new position is calculated using the force applied on the point masses and we see a constant motion. With no damping we see the cloth swing back and forth and the movement is much faster because we are seeing the full calculated range of motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can see that as we increase the spring constant for the cloth, the cloth gets stiffer and becomes less form fitting over the sphere. For the k_s = 500 example, we can make out the entire top half of the sphere and even portions of the lower half through the draped cloth. For the k_s = 50000 example we can somewhat make out the sphere from under the cloth, but much more of the cloth is laid over the top of the sphere and it is visibly stiffer. We can also see the lowest point of the cloth while draped over the sphere going up, as more of the cloth is strictly held together as it keeps its form with the higher spring constants.

    <p>
      As we increase the density of the cloth, we can see that the folds in the cloth get more complicated. This is likely because with a low density, the fabric is able to somewhat neatly cascade onto the ground plane and result into a somewhat folded sheet with very little self collision. As we then increase the density, we get more and more self collisions with results in more complex geometry. The actual results of the higher density models may be limited by the geometry of our cloth, as we result in a state where the cloth is constantly weighing on itself and bouncing a lot, giving us the strange wave patterns we see in the higher density images.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      In short, a shader program is a program that can be run on the GPU. In this homework we used OpenGL and GLSL as our shading language, although there are many other varieties. When going through the graphics pipeline, our data will encounter the vertex shader. This shader is run once per frame on every vertex and will generally apply transformatioins to the vertices and write out the final position, such as the bump mapping we implement later in this section. Near the end of the pipeline is the fragment shader, that will run once per fragment and is reponsible for giving the final image all of its color. This is also where we do any lighting or material computation. Together, these shaders let us input some geometry, define properties about its vertices, and then color or shade it as we desire.
    </p>

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Blinn-Phong shading adds on top of diffuse shading. Diffuse shading will illuminate vertices if they are visible to the scene's light source by calculating the dot product between the normal and the light source for every vertex, with the strength of the lighting being calculated with some constant from the light, divided by the distance from the light squared. This results in a basic model where we can see some highlights and shadows. Blinn-Phong adds an ambient light component, or some basic illumination that all fragments will recieve, and a specular component which is calculated with the dot product between the normal and the bisector between the camera and light source. All of these components together result in a slightly specular colored mesh.

    <p>
      While bump and displacement mapping are both used with the intent of using some texture to modify the (non-surface) appearance of geometry, they work in slightly different ways. Bump mapping simply adjusts the normals of the mesh such that any lighting calculations will be done as if the mesh is in the shape of the desired texture. We can see this in the bump mapped sphere where we can see highlights in parts of the grout and darkness in others. Displacement mapping on the other-hand will actually extrude the vertices in or out in the way that the texture dictates, usually in a grayscale image darker portions represent little or negative displacement, and brighter portions represent positive displacement. These modified vertex positions are then taken into account later for lighting.
